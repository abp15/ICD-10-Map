# ICD-10-Map
ICD-10 is a diagnostic and procedure coding system developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) to classify diseases, symptoms, and procedures for healthcare billing and analysis. 
We present a simple hierarchical map of ICD-10 codes with simple visualization. 
Parent codes (3 characters; A01-Typhoid fever) are connected with all children's codes ( 5 or more characters with decimal; A01.01-Typhoid meningitis).
This is intended as a support tool for diagnostic and procedural coding.
